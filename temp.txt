- Security: Ensure passwords are hashed and sensitive information is encrypted.
- Scalability: For a demo, CSV files are fine, but for a production system, consider using a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- User Experience: Focus on a clean, intuitive UI/UX design to enhance user experience.
